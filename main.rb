# Treat all possible moves the knight could make as children in a tree. Donâ€™t allow any moves to go off the board.

# Decide which search algorithm is best to use for this case. Hint: one of them could be a potentially infinite series.

# Use the chosen search algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting square (or node) and the ending square. Output what that full path looks like, e.g.:
